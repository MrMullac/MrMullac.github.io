            <p>Neuroplasticity is the ability of neural networks in the brain to change through growth and reorganization. In simpler terms its when the brain rewires it self to function in some ways that differ to previously. Some ways to improve your neuroplasticity is as simple as imaging that your are participating in act of improve a skill, for example there was a study of two groups one group practiced on a piano and the other just imagined it and it turned out in the first 3 days they were at the same level of skill although the physical group pulled away in later days the neurological ones could catch up quickly. Neuroplasticity benefits you because you are revisiting memorys and creating a stronge neuro link enabling you to have more information and faster. You can engage in neuroplasticity just by imagination that is the easiest way. - https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-brain-plasticity-2794886 </p>

            <p>Growth mindset is essientally believing. People with growth mindsets praise and reward themselves some simple terms to help look like this: "I can do this", "I am improving". Essientally having a growth mindset means you can't fail you will never fail you are improving and you are just not there YET. Nothing really surprised me as I was taught this throughout intermediate and primary school so I always knew about it. I think I need to have more of a growth mindset in this course as I haven't really thought about it since school and it was helpful back then cause I was basically encouraging myself to continue and to grow. I will intergrate growth mindset into my learning journey by prasing and rewarding myself as I don't think I really do at the momment I just move on and continue learning. - https://www.wgu.edu/blog/what-is-growth-mindset-8-steps-develop-one1904.html#openSubscriberModal</p>
            
            <h3>Blend with your learning plan and strategies

                Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.</h3>

            <p>I am defiently going to practice neuroplasticity more as I have never tried it and I think trying it will be good throughout this course as I can do that in any down time I have. And for Growth Mindset I do believe I need to have more of a growth mindset as it can only help you there is no reason not to have one as it will only help you improve and get better.</p>
