            <h3>An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS.</h3>

            <p>Essientally HTML is the barebones its like the content on the page so like any words or images or boxes that you see on the page are all created with html, CSS then comes along and basically makes the content look fancy. You are able to change colors, sizes and much more with css. But how does JavaScript come into play? Well JavaScript is like the backend side of the site it's basically the functionality for anything on the page. It brings interactivity to life on the page.</p>

            <h3>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life</h3>

            <p>Control flow is how the computer reads the code, its basically like a book it reads it top to bottom left to right. Loops basically loop until the it reaches the set amount of times it is told to loop. This can be seen as basically your reading a book and your going down the page and maybe you read something you don't quite understand so you read it again and a again until you get it, whereas in this case the loop will continue to loop until the requirements are met for the code.</p>

            <h3>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</h3>
            <p>The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programing interface for web documents. What it does is it represents the html page so that you can easily make changes to elements on the page by refering to the ID or classes so you execute javascript code to make like css changes or html changes. An example of interacting with it is I could use to press a button then once I press that button it would then create some text and make a box visible on the page.</p>

            <h3>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h3>
            <p>The way I see it is objects are used for creating a variable and then storing individual properties inside that object so a way that I have used objects in the past was I would create objects for each vehicle I wanted to be able to be rented out on my website and In the cars object it would store its name, price, how many doors and what kind of vehicle it was. I was then able to use a array to store all the objects inside of a array that would then cycle through the array and match the users answers to a car that they ordered. Essientally you want objects for storing more variables inside of the object. </p>

            <h3>Explain what functions are and why they are helpful.</h3>
            <p>Functions are one of the most important things to use in coding as they allow you to repeat and run code just buy defining and function than running that code by calling the function. This allows you to repeat the function as much as you need. You want to use a function when you know your going to need to repeat the code alot, creating a function allows you to have this little piece of code that you can call when you like to run it.</p>
