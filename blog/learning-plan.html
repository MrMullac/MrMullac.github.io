            <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
            <p>I would love any sort of job in the IT section, preferbly something to do with web development, software development or game development. I have always had this pick as my career pathway and I am happy that I am pursuing it with attending devacademy to create these skills to become a front end and back end web developer.</p>

            <h3>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning.</h3>
            <p>I feel like I am a good worker when it comes to learning when I am in a group and I would love to further improve that cause If I am to work a job in this area I need to have teamwork as a essiential skill. A few of my strengths when it comes to learning is I feel that I am a fast learner when it comes to IT and I am able to pick up on stuff quickly and I feel like I always try to create something unique or different to the average learner. I guess a limitation when it comes to learning is staying focused and not getting distracted as it can be easy to get distracted when you are on a computer as there are so many fun games haha.</p>

            <h3>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
            <p>I would love to develop my teamworking skills while im at Devacademy. I see this as a highly needed skill in the IT section as companys wont just hire one person to develop a website for them they have a big team that work together to create this big outcome that looks nice and works well so yeah I think that would be the main skill I would like see to be developed.</p>

            <h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:

                An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives
                What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</h3>

            <p>I think devacademy actually sets us up with good tools to stay focused and keep track of your time and work by giving us things like toggl that keeps track of how long we spend on each thing this helps manage workload and makes it so you can equally spread out your work. And I think a way that I can complete my work and stay ontop of my workload is just by knuckling down and getting each thing done one by one. If things start to build up and get to me I think I will communicate with my peers and seek help and advice by my facilitators.</p>

            <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
            <p>I will seek help by first asking any peers and seeking help from them if I don't get what I need I will then go to the discord and put in the help chats asking for advice and there are many people to help!</p>

            <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
            <p>I only expect the Facilitation team to be kind, friendly and helpful. As these values will help guide me and help me continue to learn. And them being there to help will keep me on track for whenever I need it.</p>

            <h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h3>
            <p>I don't really have and scheduled information, maybe every now and then I will need to go out to do something but it is never really planned. I think I need to plan walks everyday though to clear my mind and help my mindset.</p>
