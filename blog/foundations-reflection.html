            <h3>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h3>
            <p>1 - I love to help my pairs as much as I can to help them also understand.</p>
            <p>2 - Reflecting actually helps and there is a point of doing it.</p>
            <p>3 - A lot of new mindsets, new ways to think better and approach learning differently.</p>

            <h3>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
            <p>I'd argue self-awareness is the most important one when it comes to learning and programming as you need to be able to reflect and see where your at and how you can keep learning and improving. Empathy plays a role in it when you start working with others as it enables you to understand and be aware of what other people are feeling, it enables us to find problems that others may be facing. Values basically define one worded answers as to what kind of people we are, having good values will mean that you are a good person!</p>

            <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
            <p>I guess that there was so much core learning. Defieintly wouldn't have expected that beforehand.</p>

            <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
            <p>Probably any reflection on myself, I struggle to do it and I don't like talking about myself.</p>

            <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>
            <p>It helps our mindset and makes it a better learning experience, essientally for our own sake. And it will come to use when we get into a buisness.</p>

            <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
            <p>I don't think its a waste of time as it only benefits us and helps us in the long run of learning and being a better person.</p>
