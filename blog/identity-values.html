            <h3>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</h3>

            <p>Funny enough the most recent ethical decision that I made was helping these two butterflys that had just come out of their chrysalis, they both had deformed wings and weren't able to fly. The butterflys keep on trying to run onto our drive way and the road and I would constantly find them in places they could get ran over so I would always pick them up and take them back to the safe grassy area. Not even kidding I had to pick them up 15 times. I guess this shows my values of being kind and caring to anything and anyone. Looking back at the decision I never really thought of what I was actually doing I just did it cause it seemed like a good thing to do.</p>

            <h3>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</h3>
            <p>I think that the values that I have, I inherited from my parents. They are both very kind, friendly and hard working people and that has helped me by them being themselves made me a better person and they brought me up well.</p>

            <h3>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</h3>
            <p>I have a few strengths that help me strive on my learning journey, I am a collabrative worker so I like to work with others and I work well with people. Throughout school I found that working in group projects I would be able to work well with others so I am excited for the pair to pair coding at Devacademy and I'm really looking forward to any group projects. I am motivated and dedicated, very dedicated if its something that I enjoy which is why I chose to come to Devacademy. Most of all I enjoy learning new things (espciallly related to code/computers).</p>

            <h3>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</h3>
            <p>The only limitation I think I have is my queitness, I am quite a shy individual and I only really like to talk to people that I already know, but after getting to know people better I become less shy.</p>
            
            <h3>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h3>
            <p>I think the only time that I had resistance when working with others was when the other members in my group weren't doing anything to help me with the project and I kind of had to do the whole thing myself and they still got the same grades as me. I think my mistake was not trying any strategies to get others to do work aswell, and my reflection of what I would do differently is at the time I should've chosen different people cause I did know that they weren't the best workers but since I was friends with them I still went with them.</p>
