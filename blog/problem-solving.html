           <h3>Discuss were blocked on a simple problem:</h3> 
            <p>On the javascript Kata I got stuck on debee.js and it was actually a really simple problem, I was trying to filter out the words buzz but what I didn't realise I had to to is I had to filter some words that had different captilisations in the word so like BuZZ and what I was doing originally only removed buzz with no upper cases, The techniques I used to solve this issue is that I broke down what I needed to do by using Pseudocode which then helped me understand what I needed to do which was making all the words have no capitals. It felt annoying when things don't go your way but I always have the mindset of I will figure this out and I can always ask for help. I learnt to make sure I am fully reading what the questions are asking me of and defieintly try to plan a bit better.</p>

            <h3>Discuss elegantly solved a problem:</h3>
            <p>The problem was a challenge in the Javascript Kata the whereAreYou.js, I didn't really understand the .find function and when I did try it it wouldn't work. I had to go back and research a little to try understand more as to why the code I had written wasn't working. I re read the question and realised there was a hint on the other file that I kind of needed which helped me out  and made it work. I just kind of realised that I was missing something that I needed so I guess again I needed to read through the question multiple times to fully understand it.</p>

            <h3>Pseudocode</h3>
            <p>I feel pretty confident on using Pseudocode I learnt how to do it during school and it is the easiest one I find to use and the most helpful.</p>

            <h3>Trying Something</h3>
            <p>This is another one I use a lot just keep trialing and erroring till I am able to get it.</p>

            <h3>Rubber ducky method</h3>
            <p>Personally I haven't tried this method yet, I didn't particularly like the sound of this method so I never tried it.</p>

            <h3>Reading error messages</h3>
            <p>Trial and error again one of the keys to solving problems this helps a lot as errors can give you a lot of info on whats going wrong.</p>

            <h3>Console.logging</h3>
            <p>This is another method that helps a lot, I would say I am pretty confident with it as I feel like I've been taught young to use console logs to fix anything that isn't working.</p>

            <h3>Googling</h3>
            <p>I am very confident with this one as I feel like google is one of the most helpful places for finding new information or fixing any issues cause theres a big chance that someone else would have already had the same issue that your dealing with and would have already made a post about it.</p>
            
            <h3>Asking your peers for help</h3>
            <p>I haven't really come to this yet but if I need to I will.</p>

            <h3>Asking Coaches for help</h3>
            <p>I haven't had to use this yet but I will if I need to.</p>

            <h3>Improving your process with reflection</h3>
            <p>I think reflecting is always helpful with making more improvements.</p>

            <h3>Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so.</h3>
            <p>I guess I never really ask for help as I always use one of the methods above that helps me solve my problems but I feel like if I would need to ask for help I would be reluctant as I don't wanna look "Stupid" even though any question isnt a stupid question.</p>
